USC Map
=======================

USC Map is an application that queries a spatial database. 

Description:

A new Public Announcement System is getting installed at the
campus. We need a system to keep track of all the area that this
new announcement System can cover. Each Announcement
System is represented as a point with a radius for coverage and
each building is represented as a polygon.
